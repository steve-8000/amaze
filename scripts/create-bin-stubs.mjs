// Pre-populate the dist/*.js targets of each workspace `bin` entry.
//
// pnpm (and to a lesser extent bun) try to create bin symlinks from every
// dependent workspace's node_modules/.bin to the declared target inside each
// producer workspace (e.g. packages/agent/node_modules/.bin/pi-ai ->
// packages/ai/dist/cli.js). On a fresh clone, those dist files don't exist
// yet and pnpm prints `ENOENT ... chmod ... dist/cli.js` WARN lines for every
// dependent. Running build immediately after does create them, but by then
// the warnings are already on screen.
//
// This script runs as the root `preinstall` hook. It writes a minimal Node
// shebang stub for every missing bin target so the symlink succeeds cleanly.
// The real build step overwrites these stubs with the actual compiled CLI.
