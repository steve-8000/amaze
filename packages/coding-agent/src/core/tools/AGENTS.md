# packages/coding-agent/src/core/tools

Built-in tool implementations. **Prefer extensions for new tools** — this dir exists only for tools that ship in upstream `pi-mono` and need parity. The amaze-specific extras (`apply_patch`, web search, code execution, computer use) are builtin extensions, not core tools.

## TOOL DEFINITION SHAPE

```typescript
{
   name: "<tool>",
   description: "...",
   inputSchema: <typebox schema>,
   promptSnippet: "...",                // baked into system prompt
   promptGuidelines: ["…"],             // Tool Guidelines section
   execute: async (input, ctx) => {…},
   renderCall: (input) => <terminal output>,
   renderResult: (result) => <terminal output>,
}
```

## CONVENTIONS

- **`promptSnippet` is GLOBAL prompt content** — it lands in every model's system prompt. Be precise. The fork already corrected `bash.ts` to recommend `rg` over `grep` (2026-05-07; see `changes.md`).
- **File mutation queue is mandatory** for any tool that modifies on-disk content. Bypassing it causes interleaved-write corruption.
- **Output accumulator + truncate** must be used for long stdout. Streaming the entire output is forbidden — it will blow the context window.
- **Renderers return TUI nodes**, never raw strings. Use `render-utils.ts` helpers.
- **Tools live in core only when upstream parity demands it**. amaze-specific tools (`apply_patch`, web search, etc.) live as builtin extensions in `extensions/builtin/`.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Editing `bash.ts` `promptSnippet` to re-introduce `grep` — already fixed; amaze has a dedicated `grep` tool.
- Adding a new tool here when the same effect can be a builtin extension — bloats merge surface.
- Bypassing `file-mutation-queue.ts` — concurrent writes on the same path will corrupt.
- Hardcoding output limits — go through `truncate.ts` policy.
- Importing from `extensions/` — core tools must not depend on extension code.

## NOTES

- The `apply_patch` tool exists as a **builtin extension** under `extensions/builtin/gpt-apply-patch/`, NOT here. Its hunk math is self-contained (`patch-diff.ts` on the npm `diff` package); the piece it shares with core tools is `diff-render.ts`.
- `read.ts` handles image bytes via `utils/photon.ts` (WASM resize) before returning to the LLM. PDF handling happens in extensions.
- `find.ts` is gitignore-aware; the regression suite covers nested gitignore + glob behavior (`test/suite/regressions/3302-…`, `3303-…`).
