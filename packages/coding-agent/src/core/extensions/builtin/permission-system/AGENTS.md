# builtin/permission-system

Builtin extension #1. Full port of opencode's permission flow. Loads rules from CLI (`--permission tool=action`), settings (`permission` key: tool → action, or tool → { pattern → action }), and per-session approvals. Prompts the user for unknown tool calls, persists "always allow" decisions, blocks denied calls with a structured error, and supports parser-aware patterns (bash command prefixes, file path globs for read/write/edit/apply_patch). **JSONL storage shape is a contract — migration required to change it.**

## WHERE TO LOOK

| Task | File |
|------|------|
| Add a new tool-input parser (e.g. for a new edit tool) | `parsers.ts` |
| Change wildcard rule matching | `evaluate.ts` |
| Modify the TUI prompt | `prompt.ts` |
| Migrate JSONL approval shape | `storage.ts` — and write a one-shot migrator |
| Change "external write requires ask" policy | `external-dir.ts` |
| Add a no-UI mode | `non-interactive.ts` (used by `--mode print/json/rpc`) |

## RULE EVALUATION (order)

`evaluate.ts` is **last-match-wins** over the concatenated ruleset; later sources override earlier ones:

1. **Global settings** (`~/.amaze/agent/settings.json` `permission`).
2. **Project settings** (`.amaze/settings.json` `permission`).
3. **CLI flags** (`--permission`).
4. **Session approvals** — in-memory "always allow" rules; new ones are appended to `<projectDir>/.amaze/permissions-approved.jsonl` on session shutdown.
5. **No match** — interactive → ask; non-interactive → block (`non-interactive.ts`).

Pattern syntax: tool name + optional arg pattern, e.g. `bash:rm *`, `write:/etc/**`. Wildcard matching in `wildcard.ts`, rule lookup in `evaluate.ts`.

## CONVENTIONS

- **JSONL storage is the contract**: `storage.ts` writes append-only newline-delimited JSON. Schema changes require a migration. Other tools (audit, replay) parse this format.
- **Parsers are tool-aware**: `parsers.ts` extracts the *meaningful* arg per tool — file path for read/write/edit, command prefix for bash, file paths for `apply_patch` body (2026-04-13).
- **`external-dir.ts` forces ask** when target path is outside repo root, regardless of allow-rules — explicit user consent required.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Changing the JSONL line shape without a migration script — breaks existing approval files.
- Adding a new tool that mutates files without registering a parser in `parsers.ts` — falls back to wildcard, loses per-path granularity.
- Bypassing the parser registry from a builtin tool's render path — render and approval must agree on the displayed action.
- Hardcoding deny-list defaults in `config.ts` — leave defaults empty; ship policy via settings or examples.

## NOTES

- `apply_patch` permission scope (per-file) was added 2026-04-13 once GPT models routed file edits through `apply_patch`. Without it, every patch would fall back to wildcard edit approval.
- Print / JSON / RPC modes use `non-interactive.ts` — denies any rule not pre-approved, returning a structured error to the model.
- `events.ts` emits `permission_asked` / `permission_replied` for telemetry; downstream extensions can subscribe.
