# Twilio channel example

This example receives verified Twilio SMS and MMS webhooks and uses an editable
project-owned Fetch client for outbound messages.

```sh
pnpm run check:types
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

The Node and workerd tests execute the same REST request path against local
fake Fetch transports. They do not contact Twilio.
