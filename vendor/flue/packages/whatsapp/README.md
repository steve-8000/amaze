# @flue/whatsapp

Verified WhatsApp Business Cloud webhook ingress for Flue channels.

```ts
import { createWhatsAppChannel } from '@flue/whatsapp';

export const channel = createWhatsAppChannel({
  appSecret: process.env.WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET!,
  verifyToken: process.env.WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN!,
  webhook({ payload }) {
    // One verified Meta delivery; walk payload.entry[].changes[].
  },
});
```

The package owns GET verification, exact-body signature validation, and
forwarding Meta's provider-native webhook payload unmodified. Payload types come
from the community-maintained `@whatsapp-cloudapi/types` package. The channel
also provides canonical phone, Business-Scoped User ID, and group conversation
identity helpers. Applications own interpreting the payload,
filtering deliveries by business account or phone number, access tokens,
outbound clients, tools, dispatch policy, and deduplication.
