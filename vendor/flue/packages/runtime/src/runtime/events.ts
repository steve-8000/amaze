 * Subscribe to live workflow-run or agent-interaction activity emitted in this isolate.
 * The subscription does not replay durable workflow history or aggregate events
 * across processes or Cloudflare Durable Object isolates.
 *
 * Usage (typically at the top of `app.ts`):

 *
 *     import { observe } from '@flue/runtime';
 *
 *     observe((event, ctx) => {
 *       if (event.type === 'run_end' && event.isError) {
 *         // ship to your error reporter, metrics sink, etc.
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 * The returned function unsubscribes the listener. Most error
 * reporting and telemetry use cases register once at startup and
 * never unsubscribe — the returned function is provided for tests
 * and dynamic-wiring scenarios.
 *
 * Subscribers are invoked synchronously from the event emit path. They should
 * treat events as read-only, remain cheap, and return quickly; returned promises
 * are observed for rejection but are not awaited. Queue substantial work outside
 * the callback rather than blocking emission.
